                                exclusively
                                bamboo,
                                which is very low in nutrients. Because of this,
                                they have many unique adaptations for their low-energy lifestyle.
                                Giant pandas are solitary, with males and females coming together only briefly to mate.
                                Habitat loss is the primary threat to this species. Its popularity around the world has
                                helped the giant panda become the focus of successful conservation programs.</p>

                        <p class="general_info_1">Giant pandas are bears and are members of the Order Carnivora. They
                            are
                            unique because, although they evolved
                            among the mostly carnivorous bear species of the world, their diet is vegetarian. Despite
                            the
                            availability of other plants, they
                            feed almost exclusively on bamboo.</p>
                        <p class="general_info_2">Giant pandas communicate with one another in dense bamboo forests
                            primarily by scent. Males regularly
                            scent-mark the margins of their territories by adopting a “headstand” position to mark a
                            bamboo
                            stalk with their anogenital glands.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="physical_features">
                        <p class="physical_features_title">Physical features and characteristics:</p>
                        <p class="physical_features_1">The low nutrient value of bamboo figures prominently in the
                            biology
                            of the giant panda.
                            They have extremely powerful jaws and associated muscles to crunch through the woody stems
                            of
                            bamboo.
                            Each hand bears a specialized metacarpal bone in the wrist that functions as a thumb would
                            in
                            humans,
                            to allow them to grasp the circular bamboo stalks. While other herbivorous animals, such as
                            antelope,
                            zebras, or rabbits, have very long digestive tracts, the giant panda retains an essentially
                            bear-like
                            digestive tract. Thus, the digestive efficiency of the bamboo they consume is quite low.
                            Examination
                            of the feces demonstrates that their food has been only partially digested. The low nutrient
                            value of
                            their food and their low digestive efficiency results in an animal that is constrained to a
                            low-metabolism.
                            This lifestyle explains why giant pandas sleep so often and why they eat such enormous
                            amounts
                            of bamboo.</p>
                        <p class="physical_features_2">Individuals do not travel long distances, and males will
                            establish
                            territories that
                            are not particularly large compared with other species in the Order Carnivora. Adult females
                            average about
                            230 pounds in weight, with males sometimes reaching 350 pounds. Their hair is very dense,
                            conserving their
                            body heat in their cold habitats. Their iconic coloration remains a mystery to scientists
                            but
                            may aid with camouflage.</p>

                        <p class="lifestyle_title">Lifestyle and reproduction:</p>
                        <p class="lifestyle_1">Females are fertile for only a very short period of time and exhibit
                            delayed
                            implantation.
                            Although twins are not unusual, a mother will typically only rear one cub. Adults are
                            solitary,
                            with mating pairings being quite brief. The tiny cubs are altricial, or not born in an
                            advanced
                            state of development,
                            and are completely helpless, blind and deaf, and without the fur necessary to regulate their
                            own
                            body temperatures.
                            As a result, maternal care is extensive. Cubs do not begin eating bamboo until they are
                            around a
                            year old.</p>
                        <p class="lifestyle_2">When twins are born in zoos, extraordinary measures are taken to train
                            the
                            female to accept swapping of
                            her cubs regularly 24 hours a day, so that she only cares for one a time, but that both
                            receive
                            adequate care.</p>
