                        <div class="value">There are two species of gorilla, each containing two subspecies. The two
                            species are eastern
                            and western, and the four sub-species are <span class="color-green">Cross River</span> and

                            the Western species) and Grauer’s and Mountain (are sub-species of the Eastern species).
                            Western
                            gorillas can be distinguished from other gorilla subspecies by their brownish-gray hair,
                            auburn-colored crests and overall smaller size. Eastern gorillas tend to be black in color
                            and
                            larger in size. In all gorillas, males develop silver coloration along their backs as they
                            mature. The species is diurnal, which means they are active during the day, and of all the
                            great
                            apes, gorillas are the most terrestrial. This means that they primarily live on the ground,
                            although they do occasionally climb trees to feed and nest. They are also able to stand on
                            two
                            legs for short periods of time.

                        <div class="value">Gorillas are the largest of all primates and reach physical maturity between 
                            12 and 15 years of age. Males can be between 350 and 450 pounds, almost twice as much
                             as females, weighing in between <span class="color-green">150</span> and <span class="color-green">250</span> pounds. 
                             Males stand between 5.5 to 6 feet tall. 
                             Females are a bit smaller, standing between 4’7” to 4’11”. The males’ heads are large and 
                             pointed due to the sagittal crest that forms the back of the top of the head. This crest 
                             serves as the foundation for attachment of a great number of jaw muscle fibers, which allows 
                             for the chewing power needed to process tough vegetation.

                        <div class="value">The vision and perception of western lowland gorillas is similar to that of humans. 
                            Gorillas have a prominent brow ridge, small, flat ears, and hear about the same as humans.
                             The nose is broad, flat and fleshy. The wrinkles on a gorilla’s nose, known as a noseprint, 
                             are like human fingerprints, and every individual’s noseprint is unique. Researchers use 
                             these noseprints as identification markers in their studies, both in zoological settings 
                             and in the wild.

                        <div class="value">Gorillas have 32 teeth, including sharp canines used for defense and breaking
                             through vegetation. Their molars have complicated patterns of cups and ridges that facilitate
                              chewing of tough plant fibers.

                            and broad, flat nails Their hands are very dexterous and can pick up small, delicate objects. 
                            Like their hands, their feet have opposable thumbs and toes. Like all apes, gorillas’ arms are 
                            longer than their legs—a feature that allows them to walk on all fours. They are called 
                            “knuckle-walkers,” meaning that they walk on the knuckles of their forelimbs and the soles 
                            of their hind limbs. This form of locomotion develops calluses on the knuckles, preserving 
                            the sensitivity of the fingertips necessary for

                            They can demonstrate aggression by charging towards perceived intruders. Typically, 
                            they will not actually hit the intruder, but rush past, turn and then charge again.

                        <div class="value">Infants have three distinct vocalizations; these are similar to the cries 
                            of a human baby. They will typically cry when hurt or frightened, resulting in an immediate 
                            response from the mother.

                        &nbsp;
                        <div class="value">Dominant males also have a distinctive smell that they use to communicate 
                            with other troops and to maintain contact with their own troop. Perhaps the most recognizable 
                            behavior performed by gorillas is chest-beating. It is primarily done by male gorillas at the 
                            end of a display meant to intimidate intruding males or predators. The sound can be heard for 
                            long distances. Females will chest-beat infrequently; they will typically beat their hands 
                            against the insides of their thighs. Chest-beating can also indicate playful behavior, 
                            however, especially in the young. Young gorillas play much like humans do, playing tag 
                            and doing somersaults.

                       &nbsp;
                       <div class="value">Western lowland gorillas live in family groups known as troops. 
                            These troops can consist of 5 to 30 individuals, although the average size is 11. 
                            The group is led by a dominant silverback male and contains several adult females and their young. 
                            The females will typically bond with the silverback, but not necessarily with each other. 
                            The silverback will remain dominant for as long as he can defeat competing males.                           
                        </div>
                        &nbsp;
                        <div class="value">There are several younger, blackback males that remain in the group until 
                            they are capable of challenging the silverback. These young males are often driven out of
                             the troop to live a solitary life or to live in a smaller group with other bachelors until 
                             they establish their own troops. If a dominant silverback is displaced, the new dominant male 
                             will typically kill the infants in the troop, sending the females prematurely 
                             into reproductive cycling. This increases the male’s chances of siring offspring, 
                             as his time as the dominant male is uncertain. As such, females consider a male’s 
                             ability to fight paramount to their offspring’s survival.

                        &nbsp;
                        <div class="value">On maturing, females will also leave their natal group to join a lone male 
                            or another small group. This is vital to prevent inbreeding and to protect the gene pool.

                        <div class="value">Nesting typically occurs in the late afternoon, with the gorillas bedding 
                            down for the night at sundown. The females and their offspring will build nests of leaves 
                            and branches, while the dominant silverback will settle at the base of the tree, in order 
                            to protect his family. At Zoo Atlanta, while the gorillas are outside, their indoor areas 
                            are thoroughly cleaned; the walls and floors are scrubbed with 
                            <span class="color-green">disinfectant</span>. The gorillas 
                            are offered hay in their indoor area at night and nest with this material, replicating

                        <div class="value">In a troop, the single silverback male will mate with the females, 
                            siring all the offspring of the troop. Females generally reach reproductive maturity 
                            between 7 and 8 years of age, with males reaching maturity later, around 10 years of age, 
                            due to competition. The potential breeding season is year-round and gestation typically 
                            takes 256 days, or about 8.5 months. Labor can last anywhere from one to 4 hours. Babies 
                            are usually born singly; twins are rare. Newborns weigh between 3 and 5 pounds and are 
                            weaned around 2 to 3 years of age, but can be dependent on their mothers for up to 4 years. 
                            The average interval between births for a female gorilla is four to six years.

                        <div class="value">Western lowland gorillas prefer the tall, lush tropical forest of west 
                            and central Africa. The herbs, shrubs and vines that make up its diet grow best where 
                            the open canopy allows plenty of light to reach the forest floor. These tropical forests 
                            also contain a much higher diversity of arboreal substrates and foods, in particular fruit, 
                            than mountainous habitats. Western lowland gorillas live primarily on the ground and build 
                            sleeping nests on the ground or in the trees for the night.

                        <div class="value">Western lowland gorillas are primarily herbivorous, feeding on plant parts 
                            including seeds, leaves, stems, shoots, roots and flowers; however, they prefer fruit whenever 
                            it’s in season. Occasionally they will eat insects, such as termites or ants, as a supplement 
                            to their diet when they are readily available. Due to their dietary preferences, western 
                            lowland gorillas spend a lot of their time in and around trees, especially fruit trees. 
                            Even large males can sometimes be found up in the trees, but they are careful to stay near 
                            a main trunk or on larger branches that are able to support their weight. Younger, lighter 
                            gorillas may climb higher in trees, even swinging freely from branch to branch. Gorillas 
                            never completely strip vegetation from a single area; rather, the rapid regrowth of 
                            the vegetation they consume allows them to stay within a reasonable confined home range 
                            for extended periods of time.

                            collards, and primate chow. In the morning, vegetables and fruit are chopped up and
