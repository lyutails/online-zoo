                        <div class="value">Their adaptation to a terrestrial life is extensive: like all the other ratites 
                            (ostrich, emu, rhea and cassowary), they have no keel on the sternum to anchor wing muscles. 
                            The vestigial wings are so small that they are invisible under the bristly, hair-like, two-branched 
                            feathers. While most adult birds have bones with hollow insides to minimise weight and make 
                            flight practicable, kiwi have marrow, like mammals and the young of other birds. With no constraints 
                            on weight due to flight requirements, brown kiwi females carry and lay a single egg that may weigh as 
                            much as 450 g (16 oz). Like most other ratites, they have no uropygial gland (preen gland). Their bill 
                            is long, pliable and sensitive to touch, and their eyes have a reduced pecten. Their feathers lack barbules 
                            and aftershafts, and they have large vibrissae around the gape. They have 13 flight feathers, no tail and 
                            a small pygostyle. Their gizzard is weak and their caecum is long and narrow.

                            couple. During the mating season, June to March, the pair call to each other at night, and meet in 
                            the nesting burrow every three days. These relationships may last for up to 20 years. They are 
                            unusual among other birds in that, along with some raptors, they have a functioning pair of ovaries. 
                            (In most birds and in platypuses, the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional.

                        <div class="value">The eye of the kiwi is the smallest relative to body mass in all avian species resulting
                             in the smallest visual field as well. The eye has small specialisations for a nocturnal lifestyle, 
                             but kiwi rely more heavily on their other senses (auditory, olfactory, and somatosensory system). 
                             The sight of the kiwi is so underdeveloped that blind specimens have been observed in nature,
                              showing how little they rely on sight for survival and foraging. In an experiment, it was 
                              observed that one-third of a population of A. rowi in New Zealand under no environmental stress 
                              had ocular lesions in one or both eyes. The same experiment examined three specific specimens 
                              that showed complete blindness and found them to be in good physical standing outside of ocular 
                              abnormalities. A 2018 study revealed that the kiwi's closest relatives, the extinct elephant 
                              birds, also shared this trait despite their great size.

                            even similar to those of parrots and songbirds, though there is no evidence of similarly complex 
                            behaviour.

                            including humans. In areas of New Zealand where introduced predators have been removed, such as 
                            sanctuaries, kiwi are often seen in daylight. They prefer subtropical and temperate podocarp and 
                            beech forests, but they are being forced to adapt to different habitat, such as sub-alpine scrub, 
                            tussock grassland, and the mountains.

                            They also may eat fruit, small crayfish, eels and amphibians. Because their nostrils are 
                            located at the end of their long beaks, kiwi can locate insects and worms underground using 
                            their keen sense of smell, without actually seeing or feeling them.[26] This sense of smell 
                            is due to a highly developed olfactory chamber and surrounding regions. It is a common belief 
                            that the kiwi relies solely on its sense of smell to catch prey but this has not been scientifically 
                            observed. Lab experiments have suggested that A. australis can rely on olfaction alone but is not 
                            consistent under natural conditions. Instead, the kiwi may rely on auditory and/or vibrotactile cues.
